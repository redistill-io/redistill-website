This folder is intended to hold static images used by the Redistill website.

To fully mirror the upstream documentation visuals, copy the following files
from the main Redistill repository into this directory:

- docs/img/throughput.png      -> assets/img/throughput.png
- docs/img/latency.png         -> assets/img/latency.png
- docs/img/bandwidth.png       -> assets/img/bandwidth.png
- docs/img/Redistill_Architecture.png -> assets/img/Redistill_Architecture.png

Once copied, the Benchmarks and Architecture pages will render these charts
and diagrams automatically.
